								<p align="justify"> I am a civil engineer graduated at the University of Twente.  
								I like to describe myself as passionate and responsible. I am always trying to learn and discover how to 
								make life easier through engineering. Through my studies, I have gained experience in the fields of Systems Engineering and Estructural 
							    Mechanics, which are areas of my interest. At the same time, I have elaborated several models in Matlab to find solutions to diverse problems. Whereas, my 
							    professional experience has provided me with the necessary knowlegde to improve my management and design skills.    </p>

								<h2>Building a Biorobotic arm<br />
								</h2>
								<p>
								This project was part of a minor course. The main goal was design and programming a robot that help people 
								that suffer DMD. In this case, the action selected was take a picture. The model of the robotic arm was modeled
								and done using SOLIDWORK. In order to manufacture it, lasser cutting and wood were used. The programming part
								of the robot were done using python. The basic idea was used the impulse of the muscle to move the robotic arm.

								This project was part of another minor course. The objective of the minor was designing an airplane 
								for 80 people without produced any emission. The fuel used for this application was hydrogen. All the aerodynamics
								calculations needed for a real airplane were performed. And, of course the cabin details such as seats, lavatories and 
								galleys were take into account. For more detail see the report
